This is a flash card game with educational purpose.

On every instance, a random French word is displayed and you can choose wether you know its meaning in English or no by clicking the corresponding buttons.

The app comes with a .csv file that contains 200 French words all with their translations to English. 

If a word is marked as known by clicking the greencheck mark button, it gets removed from the .csv file. So it won't appear on the app anymore.

If a word is marked as unknown by clicking the redcross mark button, it gets added to a new file so it can be displayed first on the next launch of the app.
